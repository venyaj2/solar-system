I plan on creating a SpaceExploration program to allow users to interact with different attributes of the solar system. The simulation will depict the solar system, including planets, the sun, moons, asteroid belt, etc.â€”with relative sizes, axes, rotations, and orbits of planets proportional to one another. When the user selects a particular region of the solar system with a mouse click, it will focus on it and provide information specific to that region. 
Being able to format space in a visual sense would give a lot of clarity to each individual attribute of space. Also, being able to focus on specific areas of interest is very appealing to me, as it adds variety to the entire program.
For the first week, I plan on developing the individual planets, sun, particular orbits, axes, and sizes. I will also add information as far as name, radius, orbital period, and any other area specific information. 
During week 2, I plan on adding moons, indivdual rotations around the sun, and stars as well, and for week three, I plan on adding texture and mouse-clicks.
