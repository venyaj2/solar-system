##Overview
I created a solarsystem simulation containing 8 planets, several moons and stars, and a sun. The planets and moons rotate around their given axes, and users can interact with the simulation.

##Requirements
Cinder OpenGL API is required for visualizations, version 0.9.2 or later.

##Installation

Steps:
1. GitClone https://github.com/uiuc-sp21-cs126/final-project-venyaj2.git
2. Open in CLion or another similar IDE through a Cinder folder
3. Run

##Code Style
I used Google C++ Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
